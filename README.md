DNA_RNA_nucleotide_counter
==========================

Count the nucleotides in a DNA (A, G, C, T) sequence or in a RNA (A, G, C, U) sequence.

COMMAND: $ perl DRnC.pl

First, select between DNA or RNA by typing 'dna' or 'rna' when the program demands it.

Second, input your sequence (it is better if it doesn't have any space between lines).
